# Courses-Recommendation-Using-Ant-Colony-Optimization
<p>Initially, ants start to move randomly in search of food around their nests. This randomized search opens up multiple routes from the nest to the food source. Now, based on the quality and quantity of the food, ants carry a portion of the food back with necessary pheromone concentration on its return path. Depending on these pheromone trials, the probability of selection of a specific path by the following ants would be a guiding factor to the food source

## Overview

This project implements the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm. The algorithm is commonly used for solving optimization problems such as the traveling salesman problem (TSP) and other path-finding problems.

## Project Structure

- **`aco1.py`** – Main Python script implementing the ACO algorithm.
- **`coursera-courses.csv`** – A dataset file, possibly used for analysis or testing purposes.
- **`requirements.txt`** – Contains a list of required dependencies to run the project.
- **`templates/`** – A folder that may contain HTML templates if the project involves a web-based interface.
- **`.venv/`** – Virtual environment directory for managing dependencies.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository.
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Darshan-008/Courses-Recommendation-Using-Ant-Colony-Optimization.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd ACO
   ```
3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```sh
   python -m venv .venv
   ```
4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```sh
     .venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```sh
     source .venv/bin/activate
     ```
5. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Run the main script to execute the ACO algorithm:

```sh
python aco1.py
```

If applicable, additional instructions for interacting with the project will be provided inside the script.

## Dependencies

The required dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`. Ensure they are installed before running the project.
