<p>Initially, ants start to move randomly in search of food around their nests. This randomized search opens up multiple routes from the nest to the food source. Now, based on the quality and quantity of the food, ants carry a portion of the food back with necessary pheromone concentration on its return path. Depending on these pheromone trials, the probability of selection of a specific path by the following ants would be a guiding factor to the food source
